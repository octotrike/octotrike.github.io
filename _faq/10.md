question: Who's behind Trike?
---
Since 2004, Trike has been a personal project of Bren Larcom and Eleanor Saitta, with contributions from many other individuals.  Bren and Eleanor have started separate companies and hope to fund more consistent development in the future.

Bren's company, Tall Order Software LLC, is currently working on a v2 desktop tool in Smalltalk.  This development is partially funded by Digital Contract Design.

Eleanor's company, Systems Structured Ltd., is developing a v2 tool in Python.  This development is on hold for the moment.

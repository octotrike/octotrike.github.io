question: What's with the weird UI?
---
In some cases, it's that way because we've found some benefit in it.  In other cases, that's the native behavior of our underlying platform, [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/).  In some ways, Squeak was a default decision since our most prolific developer to date doesn't enjoy coding in any "normal" languages.  But there are some objective reasons to use Squeak as well, including that we wanted something cross-platform with good diagramming support (we hope you'll see this in v2).  Squeak is ideally suited for the live feel and dynamic updating we wanted, which has to our surprise been the source of even more positive comments than automating this stuff at all.  Finally, in many ways Trike is a research vehicle, and Squeak's development environment is excellent for prototyping new models for us to experiment with.

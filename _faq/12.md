question: Why is it called Trike?
---
Since someone has finally asked this question without prompting, here is an abridged version.  You can imagine the hand waving and exaggerated facial expressions.

Believe it or not, the project that turned into Trike was supposed to be a tool to help experienced folks do source code security review.

As we collectively realized that we needed to build our own, more systematic threat modeling tool to support this kind of code review, our last team member to come around felt like he was the host in [this episode of Monster Garage](http://www.bikemenu.com/Jesse%20James%20Peterbilt%20Discovery%20Channel%20Monster%20Garage.html).

In the episode, Jesse intends to put the engine from a semi tractor on a motorcycle, but every time he explains this to anyone else, the new person suggests a tricycle instead.  The host persists and persists in his motorcycle plan, until finally the inevitable occurs and he declares that the team is building a trike.

We never built that computer-assisted code security review tool.

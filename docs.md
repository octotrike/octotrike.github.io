# Theory
Documentation about what goes into a Trike threat model, how to construct one in general, and why it works is available from:
* [the Trike v1 white paper]({{ "/papers/Trike_v1_Methodology_Document-draft.pdf" | relative_url }})
* the help spreadsheet for [the version 1.5 Trike implementation]({{ "/tools#spreadsheet" | relative_url }}) and
* many of our [talks]({{ "/talks" | relative_url }})

# Tool-Specific
Documentation regarding how to use specific versions of Trike to construct threat models is available from:
* the help spreadsheet for [the version 1.5 Trike implementation]({{ "/tools#spreadsheet" | relative_url }}) and
* some of our later [talks]({{ "/talks" | relative_url }})

As the v2 tool gets closer to release, we expect to post help for it on this site.

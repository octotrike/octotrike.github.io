You can reach the Trike contributors via 
* our [ticket system](https://github.com/octotrike/octotrike.github.io/issues) (for bug reports, patches, feature requests and support requests) and
* the [trike-devel](https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=trike-devel) mailing list at lists.sourceforge.net.

If you'd like to hear from us (but not too often), you might try joining [trike-announce](https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=trike-announce).
